```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta name="author" content="<your names>" />
  <meta name="revised" content="<date today>" />
  <style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
    .header, .footer {
      background: lightblue;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    .sidebar {
      background: lightgreen;
      width: 150px;
      height: 200px;
    }
    .content {
      background: lightyellow;
      width: 300px;
      height: 200px;
    }    
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="header">Header</div>
  <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
  <div class="content">Main Content</div>
  <div class="footer">Footer</div>
</body>
</html>
```
### Step 1 (Static vs Relative):

- Add in css ```position: relative; top: 20px; left: 20px;``` to .sidebar.

- Guided Question: What changed compared to the default static positioning? Try to give different values to top and left or you can change it to bottom, right.

### Step 2 (Fixed):

- Add in css ```position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;``` to .footer.

- Guided Question: What happens when you scroll the page? Why does the footer behave differently from position relative?

### Step 3 (Absolute):

- Add in css ```position: absolute; top: 66px; left: 200px;``` to .content.

- Guided Question: What is the effect of position: absolute on an element? How is it different from fixed?

### Step 4 : (Absolute)

- Add in html ```<div class="notice">Notice!</div>``` and include the css below:

```css
.notice {
    position: absolute;
    top: 60px;
    left: 400px;
    background: orange;
    padding: 10px;
    z-index: 2;
}
```

- Give .content a z-index: 1.

- Guided Question: Why does the notice appear on top of the content? What happens if you swap the z‑index values?

- Challenge: 
    * What changes that you have to do on the code that will position .notice box on the top right corner of the .content box? Please write the code on paper as well (both html and css on the part of .notice and .content).
    * Try to change the position of .content to relative then to fixed. What do you observed each time?
    * What do you observe on about the effect of z-index on .notice and .content boxes?

3. Please answer the following reflection questions (15 minutes)

    a. Could you summarize the differences between the CSS position values (static, relative, absolute, fixed)? 

    b. How does absolute positioning depend on its parent element?

    c. How do you differentiate sticky from fixed (you can research on sticky)?

    d. If you were designing a webpage for a school event, how might you use positioning to highlight important information? Please give concrete examples.
